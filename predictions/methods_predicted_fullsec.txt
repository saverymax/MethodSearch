One patient underwent SLNB at an outside institution, and that patient was excluded from this analysis. We excluded patients with clinically palpable lymph nodes and patients who had already undergone wide local excision associated with a reconstructive procedure, such as a skin graft, rotational skin flap, or other surgical procedure that could interfere with the lymphatic drainage from the primary tumor. Clinical data, surgical details, histopathologic characteristics, and outcome were prospectively entered into a melanoma database, and patients with SLN mapping to the parotid region (n = 72) formed the basis of this analysis.</p>

Briefly, .05 mCi (1.9 MBq) of radiation <sup>99m</sup>Tc sulfur colloid (CIS-US, Inc., Belford, MA) filtered through a .22-<italic>μ</italic>m filter in a volume of .4 mL was injected into four quadrants of the primary lesion or around the previous biopsy site or primary tumor. Injections were performed the morning of the planned surgical procedure, and dynamic scans of all nodal basins at risk were obtained beginning immediately after injection at a rate of one frame per minute for approximately 10 minutes. Anterior and lateral static images were obtained at 5-minute intervals for 20 minutes to 2 hours. A radioactive lead marker was placed in selected patients in the external auditory canal to provide orientation in interpretation of the images. The PLSG was reviewed and discussed with the nuclear medicine physician who performed the study. Basins outside the parotid gland or on the contralateral side were considered separately.</p></sec>
16715435|Intraoperative Lymphatic Mapping and SLNB|('method', 0.9999998999999902)|('other', 1.0000000994736041e-07)|<sec id="S7"><title>Intraoperative Lymphatic Mapping and SLNB</title><p id="P9">The SLNB was performed within 4 hours of injection of the radiocolloid, and images were used to guide the procedure in the operating room. Our standardized approach for SLNB includes equipment for injection of 1% isosulfan blue dye (Lymphazurin; Hirsh Industries, Inc., Richmond, VA) and localization of the radioactive colloid. A tuberculin syringe was used to inject the blue dye in an intradermal plane on the side of the lesion nearest to the relevant draining nodes identified by PLSG. Most commonly, a volume of ≤.5 mL was used, because larger volumes tend to dissipate into the subcutaneous tissue and cause artifacts, thus complicating the procedure. A handheld gamma probe (Neoprobe 1000 [Neoprobe Corp, Dublin, OH] or C-Track [Case Wide Medical Products Corp., Morgan Hill, CA]) was used to measure radioactivity counts over the SLNs and to record the background and correlated with the PLSG findings. The gamma probe was used to measure the ex vivo radioactivity of the SLN. Reduction of the background activity of the basin to &lt; 10% of the hottest SLN was considered as indicative of excision of all SLNs. While the SLN was undergoing frozen-section analysis, the primary melanoma or surgical scar was excised by using margins according to the depth of invasion and the site of the lesion. If histopathologic examination revealed metastatic disease, parotidectomy with preservation of the facial nerve and ipsilateral modified radical neck dissection was performed as an immediate completion lymph node dissection.</p></sec>

Each SLN sent to pathology was bisected from the hilum to its periphery. Half of the node was immediately processed for frozen-section analysis by using routine hematoxylin and eosin staining, and the other half was processed for immunohistochemical staining by using antibodies to S-100 protein and HMB-45. All lymphatic and parotid tissues were embedded in paraffin and sectioned according to routine departmental protocol.</p></sec>

Follow-up was calculated in months from the date of SLNB to the date of last follow-up or death, and the disease-free interval was calculated from the date of SLNB to the date of first recurrence.</p></sec>
